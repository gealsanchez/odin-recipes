    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>The chilli and the sauce itself is known as 'piri-piri' in Portuguese. It takes its name from Swahili –
        'piri-piri' means 'pepper-pepper' – and has morphed into several iterations, including 'pili-pili' and
        'peri-peri'.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 pint ricotta cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>Step 1
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente;
        drain.</p>
    <p>Step 2
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and season
        with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>Step 3
        In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of
        noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</p>
    <p>Step 4
        Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>
